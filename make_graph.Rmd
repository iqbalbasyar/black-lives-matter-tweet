## Libraries
Let's install required library for this study.
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# for data wrangling. very helpfull for preparing nodes and edges data
library(tidyverse) 
library(lubridate)

# for building network and visualization 
library(tidygraph)
library(graphlayouts)
# already included in tidygraph but just fyi
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

# for crawling Twitter data 
library(rtweet)
```

# Case 2: Activity Network
Activity network analyzes how information is spread around the network. From this analysis, we can found how something goes viral and how people interact with it. Because this network contains all forms of Twitter communication (even a single retweet), the visualization will most likely become a hairball. You will need a lot of data featuring or filtering for visualization purposes, but in the end it will be up to your preferences.   

## Case Objective
- Analyze **Activity Network** given random keyword(s) or hashtag   
  + Visualize the activity/information network   
  + find out which cluster talk about which topic regarding the keyword   
  + Calculate the metrics, and find out who is the `key player` in the whole conversation network   

Here's the step to do this case:   
1. Gather any trending keywords or hashtag (in this case i'll use #NewNormal)   
2. Filter the data, use tweet with lots of interaction (retweet or mention)   
3. Specify which column is communicating with which, then create edges df   
4. Create nodes df and the network   
5. Build communities, Calculate SNA metrics, and identify which user is important   
6. Visualize the network    


## Build edges, nodes, and graph dataframe


```{r}
tweets <- read.csv('data/tweet_black_lives_matter.csv')
edges <- read.csv('data/edges.csv')
nodes <- read.csv('data/nodes.csv')
```


```{r}
# build graph data
network_nn <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edges, vertices = nodes, directed = T) %>%
  as_tbl_graph()
```


```{r}
# create community, calculate centrality and remove loop edge
set.seed(123)
network_nn <- network_nn %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(community = group_walktrap(),
         degree = centrality_degree(),
         between = centrality_betweenness(),
         closeness = centrality_closeness(),
         eigen = centrality_eigen()) %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  filter(!edge_is_loop())
```


```{r}
network_act_df <- as.data.frame(network_nn %>% activate(nodes))

network_nn
```


```{r}
as_data_frame(network_nn, "vertices") %>% 
  filter(between > 20000) %>% 
  filter(degree > 100)
```


## Identify a prominent person in the network
Key players in the ego network and activity network have different interpretation. In this case, the key player will be considered as a person who makes this specific keyword viral. We also can identify which person whose opinions are widely agreed upon by others. 

```{r}
kp_activity <- data.frame(
  network_act_df %>% arrange(-degree) %>% select(name) %>% slice(1:10),
  network_act_df %>% arrange(-between) %>% select(name) %>% slice(1:10),
  network_act_df %>% arrange(-closeness) %>% select(name) %>% slice(1:10),
  network_act_df %>% arrange(-eigen) %>% select(name) %>% slice(1:10)
) %>% setNames(c("degree","betweenness","closeness","eigen"))

kp_activity

```
We got interesting results here. every top centrality has a different account. It means every top user is great in their own 'job' on the network. we can tell that there's no super user in #NewNormal network. From the table above, "adrianoqalbi" grab my attention the most. he appears in 2 centrality (if we remove NA in eigenvector centrality). Thus we can conclude he is the key player in #NewNormal Twitter activity network. Let's see his tweets
```{r}
tweets
tweets %>% filter(username == "anpamanz") %>% arrange(-retweets)
```

## Visualize network
let's try to visualize the network. the network consist of 23k+ nodes and  17k+ degree. we need to filter it otherwise it'll be just hairball of nodes and edges. here i just plot top 3 community and filter the label by nodes with degree centrality >= 3 or betweenness centrality >= 100. The edges color are separated  by interaction type.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
network_nn %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(ids = row_number()) %>%
  filter(community %in% 1:1) %>% arrange(community,ids) %>%
  mutate(node_label = ifelse(degree >= 200 | between >= 10000,name,"")) %>%
  mutate(node_size = ifelse(degree >= 200 | between >= 10000,log(degree),0)) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "linear", circular = T) +
  geom_edge_arc(alpha = 0.05, aes(col = as.factor(type), edge_width = count*0.5)) +
  geom_node_label(aes(label = node_label, size = node_size),repel = T,
                 show.legend = F, fontface = "bold", label.size = 0,
                 segment.colour="slateblue", fill = "#ffffff66") +
  coord_fixed() + 
  labs(title = "Twitter Activity Network #BlackLivesMatter",
       subtitle = "Retweets and mention of #1 communities in Indonesia (May 26-30th, 2020)") +
  theme_graph() + 
  guides(edge_width = F,
         edge_colour = guide_legend(title = "Tweet Type",
                                    override.aes = list(edge_alpha = 1))) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title = element_text(size = rel(2)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = rel(1)),
        legend.text = element_text(size = rel(1)))
  
```




What can we get from this visualization?
First, lets see this table
```{r}
network_act_df %>% arrange(-degree) %>%
  group_by(community) %>% slice(1:5)
```
Now we can identify which person belongs to which community based on highest degree. The plot is arranged by community and id (row number), so user in the same community are placed near to each other. community #1 (highest community by frequency) is the only community with 2 interaction types. lots of them are retweeting (or quoting) "adrianoqalbi" tweet, and the others are people who mention "ari_maj" in their tweets. Users in community #2 and #3 are just retweeting each other, or maybe some of them make a quote tweet that also goes viral. There's a news account like (detikcom) in community #3, it'll be our evidence that those communities are driven by retweet. I can conclude that the top 3 community (by highest frequency) in Twitter activity network is well separated by its tweet types (interaction types). maybe there's another interesting insight in another community since it creates fewer accounts by each community.



# Additional business case: Competition network 
Competition network gathers all person/user who has connection to specific official account. The main idea is mapping the whole network of accounts in the same industry. for example, we want to see marketing competition in Indonesian private colleges. We gather all of their followers and from that follower, gather all their following. Build community and calculate the metrics, thus we will get important persons who has information from all competing accounts. we also can found which community is a potential 'unreached' market to several companies and how to reach them. 

![](assets/network1.png)

The graph above shows 21 Indonesian private college Instagram admission of new student network. The network is separated by 3 community, green for Muslim college, purple for Catholic/Christian college, and fuzzy cluster in the middle is what we can say as a 'neutral' college. We can conclude that these days people still looking for education based on their religion. Let's say we're a social media analyst from Binus, then we can find out how to reach UII/UMY/UMM cluster based on important person in their community (endorsement). It will give Binus a lot of engagement right?

Well, the problem is Twitter rate limitation makes it impossible to do this analysis in a short time. So i'll tell you how to do it. It's pretty simple, but takes a loong time:   

1. Select several accounts in the same industry   
2. Gather all of their followers    
3. From the follower, gather all of their following   
4. Filter to active user only (if possible)   
5. Build a network, create community and centrality   
6. Identify prominent user based on your case   
7. Visualize   

Case Objectives:   

- Analyze **Competition Network** from (for example) @kfc_id, @mcd_id, @wendys, @phd account   
  + Visualize the whole competition network    
  + Identify fanbase cluster in each account   
  + Calculate the metrics, and find out who is the `key player` in the whole network
